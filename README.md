# Create, Modify & Earn from Educational Content

We aim to connect teachers, students, and coders to make the creation of interactive educational contents easy, fun and rewarding.

## What We Do
Our authoring tools let you create highly interactive learning experiences - no coding skills required. Our learning experiences focus on simulations, games, quizzes, and interactive plotting tools that make learning more effective and engaging. Remixing, modifying and improving existing contents is made easy.

## Easy Content Creation
Our authoring tools radically decrease barriers for creating all kinds of educational contents or improving existing ones. No coding skills are needed to adapt and remix other people's simulations or educational games.

## Pedagogy over Popularity
Content creators are rewarded fairly based on how well their contents teach a knowledge concept. Our machine learning models estimate the educational value each content brings to the platform. Rewards are distributed via a blockchain-based token system - this ensures easy and secure payouts globally. This also raises the average quality of contents over time.

## Advance Learning Effectiveness
Interactive learning experiences communicate more information than static ones. The problem with static contents like textbooks and powerpoint slides, is that they dont allow for trial and error, which is necessary for effective learning.
